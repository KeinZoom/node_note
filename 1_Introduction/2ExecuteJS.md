### Browser vs Node.js
- In the browser, most of the time is interacting with the `DOM`, or other `Web Platform APIs` like Cookies. You do not have the `document`, `window` and all the other objects that are provided by the browser in Node.js.
- However, we do not have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its `modules` such as fs function in the browser.
- With `Node.js`, you control the environment; With a browser, you are at the mercy of what the users choose.
